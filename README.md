This is a repo for a simple light dimmer circuit board that takes in an
analogue value from a potentiometer and turns it into a digital PWM signal. This
PWM signal is used to dim a custom LED light I have made with 4 x 3W LED modules
and a common 3W LED constant current supply - see the links at the bottom of
this README.

The AC-DC power supply used is a Mean Well 24V 2A PSU.
